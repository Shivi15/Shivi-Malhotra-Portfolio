# [Project 1: Covid-19 Spread in US - Project Overview](https://github.com/Shivi15/Covid-19-Spread-in-US)
* Analyzed the spread and gradual shift of Covid-19 prone counties in the US.
* Found out the counties with most covid positive cases, and the highest infection rate.
* Cleaned and performed an inner merge on the two datasets, i.e. Population of each county and Covid-19 cases of these counties.
* Using tableau's racing bar charts and animation found out, only 1.04% of LA counties are infected, 3.3% of Arizona counties are infected, and New York had an alarming infection rate of 13.5%.

Letâ€™s look more closely at the top 10 counties by number of cases.
